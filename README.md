# Bad Apple With Averages  
By Alex Funk  
on January 27, 2024
## Description
* My take on the popular genre: Bad Apple but...
* Each frame of the new video is an average of the frame before it and the frame after it
* Uses the imageio library to handle the image processing
* Uses the numpy library to handle the modification of the and create the averaged image
* The final video has been uploaded to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-oeDglTsdo) for viewing
## How to Use
* createFrames.py creates the averaged frames and stores them in a folder
* createVideo.py takes the newly created frames in the folder and turns them into an mp4 file
## Credits
